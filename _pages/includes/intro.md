# Short Bio

Lin Zhao is a Senior Research Scientist at United Imaging Intelligence (UII) America. He received his PhD degree in Computer Science from University of Georgia in 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Tianming Liu](https://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~tliu/). During his PhD study, he also interned at Alibaba DAMO Academy in 2022 and United Imaging Intelligence in 2021. He received his Bachelor degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2017. His recent research interests include Brain-inspired AI, Large Foundation Models, Vision-Language Modeling and their applications in medical imaging. He has published over 50 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RxG1Wj8AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Flin-zhao-research.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top AI and medical imaging jounrals and conferences. 


# Research Interests

My research interests lie at the domain of artificial intelligence, biomedical imaging, and healthcare. I am particularly passionate about brain-inspired AI, which seeks to bridge biological and artificial intelligence and explore the fundamental nature of intelligence itself. In parallel, I aim to leverage latest AI techniques, e.g., large-scale foundation models, to tackle real-world biomedical and clinical challenges, such as data/annotation scarcity, model reliability and interpretability. Another key area of interest is biomedical image analysis, particularly using modalities like fMRI and EEG. I focus on developing data driven methods to analyze and interpret these complex signals, with applications in brain function mapping, computation neuroscience, and neurological disease diagnosis.
